# ⚠️ATTENTION!⚠️

I, [cuxdi](github.com/cuxdi), is discontinuing Mint. This was a project to work on for fun, and to learn about the terminal command prompt. This essentially is a copy of [scoop](https://scoop.sh). But I got really tired, and this project was too much for me. I worked day and night only to make such little progress. This was to be some neat liitle thing to show people at a developers coference, but I'm stopping it.
